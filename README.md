# 🎭 Comedy Writing Cognitive Architecture

A systematic approach to comedy development with advanced meta-cognitive capabilities for standup techniques, character consistency, and humor pattern recognition.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository implements a sophisticated comedy writing cognitive architecture with:

- **40 Specialized Memory Files** (20 procedural + 20 episodic)
- **Systematic Joke Development** workflows
- **Character Consistency** tracking and evolution
- **Performance Analysis** frameworks
- **Meta-Cognitive Learning** from audience feedback

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
- VS Code with comedy-specific extensions installed
- Speech recognition configured for timing practice
- Cognitive architecture memory files active

### 2. Create Your First Joke
```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/joke-templates/basic-joke-template.md comedy-projects/joke-development/premises/my-first-joke.md

# Use the systematic development workflow
# Follow .github/prompts/joke-development.prompt.md
```

### 3. Develop a Character
```bash
# Copy template  
cp templates/character-profiles/character-profile-template.md comedy-projects/characters/personas/my-character.md

# Use character creation workflow
# Follow .github/prompts/character-creation.prompt.md
```

### 4. Build a 5-Minute Set
```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/routine-structures/5-minute-set-template.md comedy-projects/standup-routines/5-minute-sets/my-first-set.md

# Use routine building workflow
# Follow .github/prompts/routine-building.prompt.md
```

## 🎯 Core Comedy Rules (Working Memory)

| Priority | Rule | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| P1 | **@timing** | Comedic timing is everything - pause placement creates laughter |
| P2 | **@character** | Maintain consistency while allowing personality evolution |
| P3 | **@audience** | Adapt material while preserving core comedic voice |
| P4 | **@learning** | Systematically analyze what works for improvement |

## 🧠 Cognitive Architecture Features

### Procedural Memory (.github/instructions/)
Automated comedy techniques for:
- Standup performance and stage presence
- Comedic timing and rhythm mastery
- Character development and consistency
- Material creation and refinement

### Episodic Memory (.github/prompts/)
Project-specific workflows for:
- Individual joke development
- Character creation and evolution
- Performance analysis and improvement
- Audience adaptation strategies

### Meta-Cognitive Monitoring
- Humor effectiveness tracking
- Character consistency validation
- Learning momentum measurement
- Performance confidence development

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Comedy Development
- **Joke Success Rate**: Percentage of material that works
- **Character Consistency**: Persona authenticity scoring
- **Timing Improvement**: Comedic rhythm development
- **Audience Adaptation**: Cross-demographic success

### Learning Acceleration
- **Creative Confidence**: Systematic humor development
- **Performance Skills**: Stage presence and delivery
- **Material Generation**: Consistent content creation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding what makes things funny

## 🎭 Current Material

### Active Routines
- **Punta Cana Disaster** (5-minute set) - Romance fail to relationship win

### Characters in Development
- Self-deprecating hapless romantic husband

### Joke Development Pipeline
- Travel disaster material
- Relationship humor
- Self-deprecation techniques

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Daily Practice (10-15 minutes)
1. **Observation Journal** - Notice 3 funny things
2. **Character Development** - Add one detail to personas
3. **Material Polish** - Improve existing jokes

### Performance Cycle
1. **Material Creation** → Use templates and workflows
2. **Testing and Refinement** → Safe environment feedback
3. **Performance** → Live audience testing
4. **Analysis** → Systematic improvement extraction
5. **Evolution** → Character and material development

## 🛠️ Development Tools

### VS Code Integration
- Speech recognition for timing practice
- Markdown preview for material review
- File associations for comedy file types
- Cognitive shortcuts for quick creation

### Git Workflow Integration
- **Comedy-save alias**: Quick material commits with `git comedy-save "message"`
- **Performance tracking**: Structured before/after show documentation
- **Character evolution**: Systematic persona development tracking
- **Learning extraction**: Pattern recognition and improvement commits
- **Material versioning**: Track joke refinement and routine evolution

See `GIT-WORKFLOW.md` for complete Git integration guide.

### Memory System
- Auto-consolidation of successful patterns
- Learning extraction from performance data
- Character evolution tracking
- Material effectiveness monitoring

## 📚 Learning Resources

### Procedural Knowledge
Access specialized instruction files for:
- Standup techniques and stage presence
- Timing mastery and rhythm control

## 🎪 Contributing

This cognitive architecture learns and evolves:

1. **Performance Data** → Feeds back into effectiveness tracking
2. **Character Evolution** → Updates consistency models
3. **Successful Patterns** → Consolidates into procedural memory
4. **Failed Experiments** → Archives for learning analysis
