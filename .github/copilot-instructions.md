# Comedy Writing - Cognitive Memory Architecture

IMPORTANT: This file serves as Global Declarative Memory for comedy writing. Specialized execution resides in procedural and episodic memory files.

## ðŸŽ­ Cognitive Architecture Status

**Working Memory**: 4/4 rules (at optimal capacity)
**Consolidation**: Auto-trigger when exceeding capacity
**Memory Distribution**: Active across procedural (.instructions.md) and episodic (.prompt.md) systems
**Comedy Focus**: Standup techniques, character development, humor pattern recognition

## ðŸŽª Working Memory - Comedy Rules (Limit: 4 Critical Rules)

| Priority | Rule                                                                                        | Load   | Auto-Consolidate     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| P1       | `@timing` - Comedic timing is everything - pause placement and rhythm create laughter       | High   | Never                |
| P2       | `@character` - Maintain character consistency while allowing personality evolution          | Medium | >30 days unused      |
| P3       | `@audience` - Adapt material to audience while preserving core comedic voice                | High   | When context changes |
| P4       | `@learning` - Systematically analyze what works and what doesn't for continuous improvement | Medium | When patterns emerge |
