**Material**: The original romance fail as attention grabber
**Key Points**:
- Strong attention grabber with immediate relatability
- Establish self-deprecating husband character
- Set expectation for vacation disaster theme

```
Opening Material:
"So my wife and I just got back from Punta Cana. Beautiful place, all-inclusive resort, romantic suite... First night there, we're getting intimate, and I trip over the decorative bench at the end of the bed.

[pause]

Broke my rib. Turns out the only thing that wasn't all-inclusive was my coordination.

[pause for laugh]

And that was just the beginning..."
```

### Main Content (3.5 minutes)

#### Bit 1: The Hospital Adventure (90 seconds)
**Setup**: Continuation of the injury story
**Punchlines**: 4-5 laugh points about Dominican hospital experience
**Transition**: From physical injury to emotional damage

```
Bit 1 Material:
"So now I'm in a Dominican hospital at midnight, trying to explain in broken Spanish how I broke my rib. The doctor asks, 'Accidente?' I said, 'No, mi esposa es muy bonita.'

[pause]

They gave me painkillers and a lecture about furniture safety. Apparently this happens more than you'd think. There's actually a whole wing dedicated to 'Resort Romance Injuries.' 

The nurse told me I wasn't even the worst case that week. Some guy dislocated his shoulder trying to be romantic with chocolate-covered strawberries. 

[pause]

I felt better about myself until she mentioned he was 75."
```

#### Bit 2: All-Inclusive Reality Check (90 seconds)
**Setup**: Building the "all-inclusive" callback theme
**Punchlines**: What else isn't actually included
**Callback Opportunity**: Continuing the resort theme

```
Bit 2 Material:
"But the resort kept advertising 'all-inclusive.' I started making a list of what wasn't included:

My dignity - not included.
Basic motor skills - definitely not included.
My wife's respect - that'll be extra.

[pause]

The minibar was all-inclusive, but apparently my ability to walk past furniture sober was a premium upgrade I didn't purchase.

They had 24-hour room service, but no 24-hour therapy for men who can't navigate luxury bedrooms.

[pause]

Although the concierge did offer to bubble-wrap the furniture for an additional fee."
```

#### Bit 3: The Rest of the Vacation (90 seconds)
**Setup**: How the injury affected the entire trip
**Climax Moment**: Biggest laugh should be here
**Bridge to Closer**: How this leads to relationship insights

```
Bit 3 Material:
"So I spent the rest of the vacation walking around like I was auditioning for a pirate movie. 

[demonstrate slight hunched walk]

My wife's taking Instagram photos: 'Beautiful sunset!' And I'm in the background looking like Quasimodo at Club Med.

[pause]

Day three, we're at the beach, she's in a bikini, looking amazing, and she asks, 'Can you put sunscreen on my back?' I said, 'Honey, I can't even put a shirt on my back.'

[pause]

But you know what? She still loved me. Even though I'd turned our romantic getaway into a medical documentary.

That's when I realized she wasn't just my wife... she was my physical therapist, my nurse, AND my travel insurance."
```

### Closing (45 seconds)
**Purpose**: End on highest note, leave strong impression
**Callback Integration**: Return to the all-inclusive theme
**Final Punchline**: Last big laugh with relationship payoff

```
Closing Material:
"So we're home now, I'm healed up, and we're planning our next vacation. 

[pause]

I asked the travel agent, 'Do you have any resorts that are injury-proof?' She said, 'Sir, have you considered a nice hotel room... on the ground floor... with no furniture?'

[pause]

I said, 'Book it. And make sure it's all-inclusive.'

[beat]

'Especially the bubble wrap.'"
```
