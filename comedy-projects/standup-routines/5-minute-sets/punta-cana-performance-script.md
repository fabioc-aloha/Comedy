## ðŸŽ¬ PERFORMANCE SCRIPT

### OPENING (45 seconds)
*Energy: High, conversational, setting up the story*

**"So my wife and I just got back from Punta Cana. Beautiful place, all-inclusive resort, romantic suite..."**
*[Pause - let them picture paradise]*

**"First night there, we're getting intimate, and I trip over the decorative bench at the end of the bed."**
*[Pause - let the visual land]*

**"Broke my rib."**
*[Beat - quick, matter-of-fact]*

**"Turns out the only thing that wasn't all-inclusive... was my coordination."**
*[Pause for laugh, slight self-deprecating smile]*

**"And that was just the beginning..."**
*[Trail off, building anticipation]*

---

### BIT 1: HOSPITAL ADVENTURE (90 seconds)
*Energy: Building, slight panic energy, then relief*

**"So now I'm in a Dominican hospital at midnight, trying to explain in broken Spanish how I broke my rib."**

**"The doctor asks, 'Accidente?'"**
*[Use slight accent, gesture for doctor]*

**"I said, 'No, mi esposa es muy bonita.'"**
*[Proud delivery, like this explains everything]*
*[Pause for laugh]*

**"They gave me painkillers and a lecture about furniture safety. Apparently this happens more than you'd think."**

**"There's actually a whole wing dedicated to 'Resort Romance Injuries.'"**
*[Air quotes, amazed delivery]*

**"The nurse told me I wasn't even the worst case that week. Some guy dislocated his shoulder trying to be romantic with chocolate-covered strawberries."**
*[Pause for laugh]*

**"I felt better about myself until she mentioned he was 75."**
*[Deflated delivery - took away my victory]*

---

### BIT 2: ALL-INCLUSIVE REALITY (90 seconds)
*Energy: Building list energy, getting more animated*

**"But the resort kept advertising 'all-inclusive.' I started making a list of what wasn't included:"**
*[Set up list format - audience knows structure now]*

**"My dignity - not included."**
*[Count on finger]*

**"Basic motor skills - definitely not included."**
*[Second finger, emphasize 'definitely']*

**"My wife's respect - that'll be extra."**
*[Third finger, pause for relationship humor]*

**"The minibar was all-inclusive, but apparently my ability to walk past furniture sober was a premium upgrade I didn't purchase."**
*[Pause for irony to land]*

**"They had 24-hour room service, but no 24-hour therapy for men who can't navigate luxury bedrooms."**
*[Pause]*

**"Although the concierge did offer to bubble-wrap the furniture for an additional fee."**
*[Delivery like this was a real offer]*

---

### BIT 3: REST OF VACATION (90 seconds)
*Energy: Peak energy, physical comedy, building to emotional payoff*

**"So I spent the rest of the vacation walking around like I was auditioning for a pirate movie."**
*[Demonstrate slight hunched walk - brief physical bit]*

**"My wife's taking Instagram photos: 'Beautiful sunset!'"**
*[Happy, excited voice for wife]*

**"And I'm in the background looking like Quasimodo at Club Med."**
*[Pause for visual]*

**"Day three, we're at the beach, she's in a bikini, looking amazing, and she asks, 'Can you put sunscreen on my back?'"**
*[Set up romantic request]*

**"I said, 'Honey, I can't even put a shirt on my back.'"**
*[Pause for laugh]*

**"But you know what? She still loved me. Even though I'd turned our romantic getaway into a medical documentary."**
*[Shift to sincere, grateful tone]*

**"That's when I realized she wasn't just my wife..."**
*[Pause, building to big finish]*

**"She was my physical therapist, my nurse, AND my travel insurance."**
*[Big finish - count on fingers, crescendo delivery]*

---

### CLOSING (45 seconds)
*Energy: High celebration, callback satisfaction*

**"So we're home now, I'm healed up, and we're planning our next vacation."**
*[Back to conversational, setting up closer]*

**"I asked the travel agent, 'Do you have any resorts that are injury-proof?'"**

**"She said, 'Sir, have you considered a nice hotel room... on the ground floor... with no furniture?'"**
*[Pause for laugh]*

**"I said, 'Book it. And make sure it's all-inclusive.'"**
*[Pause, callback recognition]*

**"'Especially the bubble wrap.'"**
*[Final button - quick delivery]*

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Performance Notes

### Critical Pauses
1. **After "intimate"** - Let them picture romance
2. **After "broke my rib"** - Let injury register  
3. **After "mi esposa es muy bonita"** - Cultural humor needs time
4. **Before "physical therapist, nurse, AND travel insurance"** - Big payoff needs setup

### Physical Elements
- **Injured walk**: Slight hunch, careful movement (don't overdo)
- **Counting on fingers**: For "all-inclusive" list and final revelation
- **Doctor gesture**: Slight accent work for hospital scene

### Energy Arc
**Start**: Medium-high (vacation excitement)
**Hospital**: Slight panic, then relief
**All-Inclusive**: Building frustration/humor
**Beach Scene**: Peak physical comedy
**Wife Revelation**: Emotional high point
**Closing**: Celebration/resolution

### Backup/Adaptation Notes
- **If time is short**: Cut the 75-year-old comparison
- **If audience is cold**: Add more physical comedy to injured walk
- **If killing**: Extend the "all-inclusive" list with more items
- **Emergency short version**: Opening + All-inclusive bit + Closing = 3 minutes
