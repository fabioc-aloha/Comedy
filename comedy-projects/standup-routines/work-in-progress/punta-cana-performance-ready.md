# Punta Cana Romance Fail - Performance Ready Version

## Optimized for Timing and Delivery

### Final Joke Structure

**Setup** (Build romantic expectation):
```
"First night in our all-inclusive suite in Punta Cana... 
[pause] 
Beautiful room, romantic atmosphere, my wife and I are finally getting... intimate... 
[pause]
And I trip over the decorative bench at the end of the bed."
```

**Punchline** (Quick delivery):
```
"Broke my rib. 
[beat]
Turns out the only thing that wasn't all-inclusive... was my coordination."
```

### Timing Breakdown
- **Setup buildup**: 8-10 seconds (build anticipation)
- **Pre-punchline pause**: 1 second (let anticipation peak)
- **Punchline delivery**: 3-4 seconds (quick punch)
- **Post-punchline pause**: 2 seconds (let it land)
- **Total**: ~15 seconds

### Performance Notes

#### Vocal Delivery
- **Setup tone**: Dreamy, romantic buildup
- **"Intimate" word**: Slightly embarrassed/shy delivery
- **Crash moment**: Matter-of-fact, deflated
- **Punchline**: Self-deprecating but confident

#### Physical Comedy
- **Opening**: Relaxed, setting romantic scene
- **Trip description**: Minimal gesture showing stumble
- **Rib touch**: Brief hand to side
- **Recovery**: Shrug acceptance of fate

#### Audience Management
- **Eye contact**: Scan during setup, direct eye contact on punchline
- **Energy**: Start high (romantic), crash low (injury), rebuild with punchline
- **Pause placement**: Critical - let them anticipate, then deliver

### Extension Opportunities

**If it gets good response, add:**
```
"The hospital bill wasn't all-inclusive either. 
But hey, at least I got to see a different kind of suite... the emergency suite."
```

**Or build into vacation disasters:**
```
"And that was just night one. By day three, I'd figured out what else wasn't all-inclusive: 
sunscreen that actually works, food that doesn't fight back, and apparently basic human dignity."
```

### Character Voice
**Persona**: Self-aware hapless romantic
- Acknowledges the absurdity
- Doesn't blame wife or resort
- Finds humor in own misfortune
- Relatable everyman who tries hard but fails
