# Punta Cana Romance Fail - First Joke Development

## Basic Setup-Punchline Structure

### Premise
**Topic**: Romantic vacation mishap in luxury resort
**Angle**: The irony of breaking yourself in paradise during intimate moments
**Universal Element**: Everyone can relate to embarrassing moments ruining romantic situations

### Setup
**Context**: First night at expensive all-inclusive resort in Punta Cana, romantic suite setting
**Expectation**: This should be the perfect romantic getaway moment
**Word Count**: 22 words (aim to tighten to under 20)

```
Setup: First night in our fancy Punta Cana all-inclusive suite, my wife and I were getting romantic when I tripped over the bed bench.
```

### Punchline
**Surprise Element**: Instead of romance, ends up in medical emergency
**Logic Connection**: Expensive vacation becomes expensive medical bill
**Delivery Note**: Pause before "all-inclusive" for emphasis

```
Punchline: Broke my rib. Turns out the only thing that wasn't all-inclusive was my coordination.
```

### Variations
**Alternative Punchlines**:
1. "Broke my rib. Nothing says 'honeymoon suite' like calling for a stretcher instead of room service."
2. "Broke my rib. I paid extra for the romance package, not the emergency room package."
3. "Broke my rib. The resort promised unforgettable memories - mission accomplished."
4. "Broke my rib. Apparently 'all-inclusive' doesn't cover dignity or basic motor skills."

### Delivery Variations
- **Timing Approach**: Build up the romantic expectation, then quick crash
- **Character Voice Option**: Self-deprecating hapless romantic
- **Physical Element**: Minimal gesture showing the fall, hand to rib area

### Setup Alternatives (Tighter Versions)
```
V1: First night in Punta Cana, fancy suite, getting romantic with my wife... tripped over the bed bench.
V2: Expensive all-inclusive resort, romantic suite, perfect moment with my wife, and I trip over furniture.
V3: Punta Cana honeymoon suite, romantic evening, and I managed to break myself on a bench.
```

### Testing Notes
**Date Created**: July 13, 2025
**Target Venue**: Open mic / Friends first
**Audience Response**: [To be tested]
**Success Rating (1-10)**: [To be rated]
**Improvement Notes**: 
- Could add detail about what happened after (hospital visit?)
- Might work better as part of longer vacation disaster story
- Could build into callback material about "all-inclusive" not covering various things

### Development Notes
**Personal Truth**: ✅ Real experience adds authenticity
**Relatable Element**: ✅ Everyone has embarrassing romantic moments  
**Visual Comedy**: ✅ Audience can picture the scene
**Self-Deprecation**: ✅ Laughing at yourself, not at wife
**Callback Potential**: ✅ "All-inclusive" could be running gag

### Next Steps
1. **Test with friends** - Try different punchline versions
2. **Time it out** - Practice pauses and rhythm
3. **Consider extension** - Could this be part of longer vacation bit?
4. **Callback development** - What else wasn't "all-inclusive"?
