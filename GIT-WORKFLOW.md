## Branching Strategy for Comedy Development

### Main Branch: `master`
- Stable, performance-ready material
- Tested jokes and routines
- Proven character work

### Development Branches
```bash
# Create feature branch for new material
git checkout -b joke/travel-disasters
git checkout -b character/anxious-parent
git checkout -b routine/5min-relationships

# Work on material, then merge when ready
git checkout master
git merge joke/travel-disasters
```

### Experimental Branches
```bash
# For risky or experimental material
git checkout -b experiment/dark-humor-test
git checkout -b experiment/crowd-work-integration

# Keep experimental - don't merge unless successful
```

## Useful Git Commands for Comedy

### Review Recent Work
```bash
# See comedy-related commits
git joke-log

# Review performance-related work
git performance-review

# See what changed in last commit
git show HEAD

# Compare versions of a joke/routine
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD comedy-projects/jokes/my-joke.md
```

### Backup and Recovery
```bash
# Create backup before major changes
git tag backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Recover previous version of material
git checkout HEAD~1 -- comedy-projects/routines/my-routine.md

# See all versions of a file
git log --follow -- path/to/joke.md
```

### Collaboration Features
```bash
# Add remote repository (if working with writing partners)
git remote add origin [repository-url]

# Push your comedy work
git push origin master

# Get updates from collaborators
git pull origin master
```

## Performance Integration Workflow

### Before Each Performance
1. **Commit current state**
   ```bash
   git comedy-save "ðŸŽ¬ Pre-performance: [venue] - material locked"
   ```

2. **Create performance branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b performance/$(date +%Y%m%d)-venue-name
   ```

3. **Make performance-specific adjustments**
   ```bash
   git comedy-save "ðŸŽ¯ Venue adaptation: [specific changes for audience]"
   ```

### After Each Performance
1. **Document results**
   ```bash
   git comedy-save "ðŸ“Š Performance results: [success metrics and audience feedback]"
   ```

2. **Extract learnings**
   ```bash
   git comedy-save "ðŸ§  Learning extraction: [what worked, what didn't, improvements needed]"
   ```

3. **Merge successful changes back**
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge performance/$(date +%Y%m%d)-venue-name
   ```

## Git Aliases Reference
